# -Greedy-Guess-and-Test-method-for-construction-QC-LDPC-codes-with-CPM-of-weigth-more-than-1.
The GitHub repository contains an implementation of Fossorier's Greedy Guess-and-Test method for constructing Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check (QC-LDPC) codes with circulant permutation matrices (CPM) of weight more than 1.

This implementation is based on the article "Quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes from circulant permutation matrices" by M.P.C. Fossorier, published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory in 2004.

Overall, this repository provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in constructing QC-LDPC codes with CPMs of weight more than 1 using Fossorier's Greedy Guess-and-Test method. The implementation is based on a well-regarded research article, making it a valuable tool for those exploring the design of efficient error correction systems.
